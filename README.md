# CODECLAUSE_PROJECT2

Credit Card Fraud Detection

Aim - Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques.

Description - Apply advanced classification algorithms for identifying potential fraudulent activities.

Technologies-

a.Pandas: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. In your code, it is used to read the CSV file and display the first few rows of the dataset, as well as to check for missing values.

b.NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. Although it's not explicitly used in your code, it is often utilized behind the scenes by libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn for array operations.

c.Scikit-learn (sklearn): This is a widely used machine learning library in Python. The following components from Scikit-learn are used in your code:

1.train_test_split: A function to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2.StandardScaler: A preprocessing technique used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

3.LogisticRegression: A machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

4.classification_report and confusion_matrix: Functions to evaluate the performance of the model.

d.Imbalanced-learn (imblearn): This is a library that provides tools to deal with imbalanced datasets. In your code, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the classes in the dataset by generating synthetic samples of the minority class.

e.Machine Learning: The code demonstrates a typical workflow for a binary classification task, specifically using logistic regression to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

f.Data Preprocessing: The code includes data preprocessing steps, such as scaling the features and applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance before training the model.

g.Model Evaluation Metrics: The use of confusion matrix and classification report to assess the performance of the model is part of the evaluation phase in machine learning.
